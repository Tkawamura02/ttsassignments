        <h1 class="title">About Me</h1>
        <h3 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">General Information</h3>
        <p><strong>Who am I?</strong> <br>My name is Tiffany Kawamura and I am a Biomedical Science major student. I take 
        Applied Computing as my minor and tech programs with my free time. I am currently doing photosynthesis research 
        at ASU (Arizona State University) and attending the TTS program learning how to FullStack Develop. I also have
        an internship as a UI/UX developer virtually.
        </p>
        <p><strong>What am I passionate about?</strong> <br>I love to be around animals and be supportive to the people
        that I love. Being there for people who are unable to do so for themselves brings me immense sense of purpose
        that nothing else can bring. However, I have also recently found coding to be one of the things that I love to
        do for myself because I understand that working for others (giving them my time and having them as the source 
        of my own happiness) is not the best thing to do for personal health.</p>
        <p><strong>What am I currently doing?</strong> <br> I am currently a Call Support Representative at Blue Cross Blue
        Shield of Arizona. I got there because I applied through ASU's Education at Work Program. I enjoy my job there
        but I know that it is not my goal to stay there forever. I am also taking tech programs during my free time to 
        improve the outlook for my future (career-wise).</p>

        <h3 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Fun Facts</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>What is your favorite color and why?</strong> <br>My favorite color is blue, I am not really
            sure why it is my favorite color but it might be because it is the color of the sky. When I was younger
            I would lay on the grass and stare at the clouds and watch as they drifted by. This was the way that I 
            would peacefully think about things that made me unhappy or happy in general.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>What is your favorite animal and why?</strong> <br>Dogs or wolves, I cannot decide! I have always
            had animals ever since i was a kid. My favorite are dogs because they tend to be very loyal even in the worst
            of times. When people let me down, I knew that my furry friends would not.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Where were you born?</strong><br> I was born in Maui, Hawaii.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>How many dogs do you have?</strong> <br>I have six dogs :)

            <h3>Tiffany's Website</h3>
            <p>This is a website where I practice general skills using web design with only
                HTML and CSS. This is to build my strengths on just these coding "languages" and 
                become a better developer overall.
